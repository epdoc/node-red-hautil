# hassio-node-red-utils

Utilities for using Node-RED with Home Assistant.

Code is written in ECMAScript 2015 and beyond, which will work in Node-RED. 
But Node-RED needs ECMAScript modules to be converted to CommonJS. 
We use [Babel for this](https://babeljs.io/docs/babel-plugin-transform-modules-commonjs).
