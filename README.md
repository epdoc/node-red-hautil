# epdoc-node-red-utils

General purpose utilities for use with [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) and
[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

 * `Service` wrapper, to generate payloads for use with the Call Service node.
 * `HA` wrapper, to retrieve state from home assistant

Utilities for my personal use of Node-RED with Home Assistant. Included are:

 * A `setFan` function that is specific to my RF control of fans using both a
   [Bond Bridge](https://bondhome.io/product/bond-bridge/) to control speed, and
   wall switches to decouple the fans from power when they are off. I do this to
   prevent mains noise from blowing the delicate controllers on my Minka fans.
 * `LocationHistory` and `LocationMoving` classes that I use to monitor movement
   from our house, for gate automation purposes. These are at a pre-release
   level of quality.

## Code Notes

This module was originally written in ES6 and transpiled using Babel to generate
a module that could be loaded using `require` or `import`. Soon thereafter it
was migrated to TypeScript (developer hint: this resulted in catching quite a
few bugs). It was also migrated to [Bun](https://bun.sh/) for build and unit
testing. Bun generates a different type of module that can only be loaded in
Node-RED using a [dynamic
import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/import),
as you will see in the next section.

## Installation and Use

Perhaps the most predictable way to install this package with Home Assistant is
to add this dependency to the Node-RED `package.json` file and restart Node-RED.
Node-RED is restarted from _Settings > Add-ons > Node-Red_. The restart should
cause the module to be installed and available. For module updates you can edit
the version number in `package.json`, delete
`node_modules/epdoc-node-red-utils`, then restart Node-RED.

For convenience you can add the module to globals, so that you don't need
to specify the module in each `Function Node` where it is used.  Here are the
required changes to `/config/Node-RED/settings.json` for this to work:

```js
// Don't set module.exports yet
let settings = {
  
  // No need to touch any of the settings 

};

// Must use dynamic import because of the nature of how bun generates this module
async function loadModules() {
  const utils = await import('epdoc-node-red-utils');
  settings.functionGlobalContext['epdoc-node-red-utils'] = utils;
}

loadModules();

module.exports = settings;
```

Then, to use the following code in a [Function
Node](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/writing-functions), it's simply a matter of
accessing the global context to get the module. In this example, the Function
Node has two outputs, with the 2nd output wired to a [Call Service
node](https://zachowj.github.io/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket/node/call-service.html).


```javascript
const u = global.get("epdoc-node-red-utils");
const payload = u.newLightService('master_bedroom').on().payload();
node.send([null,{payload:payload}]);
node.send([msg,null]);
node.done();
```

Unfortunately there is no code completion in Node-RED's Function Node editor.

You can find a more exhaustive discussion of various ways to use your own
libraries in Node-RED [here](./NODE-RED.md).

## Service Class

The
[Service](https://github.com/jpravetz/epdoc-node-red-utils/blob/master/src/service.ts)
object is used to build a payload that can be passed to the [Call Service
node](https://zachowj.github.io/node-red-contrib-home-assistant-websocket/node/call-service.html).
Provided too are a number of subclasses for specific types of entities,
including `SwitchService`, `LightService`, `AlarmService`, `CoverService`,
`FanService` and, finally `FanSpeed6Service`, which is a 6-speed fan that uses a
[Bond Bridge](https://bondhome.io/product/bond-bridge/) to set the fan speed and
a smart switch to turn the fans on and off. 

There is the possibility for many more subclasses, or you can build your service
payload directly using the base `Service` class, or one of the other subclasses. 

The following shows the code for a [function
node](https://nodered.org/docs/user-guide/writing-functions) that uses three
equivalent implementations to tell a
[Cover](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/cover/) to stop.

```js
let payload = newService('cover.garage').service('stop_cover').payload();

payload = new CoverService('garage').stop().payload();

let payloadBuilder = newCoverService('garage');
payload = payloadBuilder.stop().payload();
msg.payload = payload;
return msg;
```

The following function node code creates a payload that can be used to set a
light's brightness to 50%.

```js
msg.payload = new LightService('bedroom').percentage(50).payload();
return msg;
```

The following function node code shows several ways to create a payload that
turns a light on.

```js
// In this example we directly use the LightService, 
// which will set the domain to `light` for us. 
// The LightService is a subclass of SwitchService.
msg.payload = new LightService('bedroom').on().payload();

// In this example we use the SwitchService, but change it's default
// domain from `switch` to `light` by specifying the full `entity_id`.
msg.payload = new SwitchService('light.bedroom').on().payload();

// Override the default domain using the `domain` method.
msg.payload = new SwitchService('bedroom').domain('light').on().payload();
return msg;
```

## HA Class

The
[HA](https://github.com/jpravetz/epdoc-node-red-utils/blob/master/src/service.tsbond)
class is again meant for use in Function Nodes. It provides a wrapper for a Home
Assistant instance, and has methods to access the state of Home Assitant
entities.

Example retrieves the state of a light.

```js
const gHA = global.get('homeassistant');

const ha = new HA(gHA);
const lightEntity = ha.entity('light.bedroom');
const isOn = lightEntity.isOn();
node.warn(`The ${lightEntity.id} is ${isOn?'on':'off'}`)
```

### HA retrieveSensorsData method

This method takes a dictionary containing an `id` field and optional `type`
field and retrieves sensor data for the listed sensors. This is a shortcut that
you might use when you have multiple sensors that you efficiently want to get
data for, and you need to access that data more than once.

```js
const gHA = global.get('homeassistant');
const ha = new HA(gHA);

const sensorDict = {
  sensor1: { id: 'input_boolean.evening', type: 'boolean' },
  sensor2: { id: 'sensor.outdoor_temperature', type: 'number' }
};

ha.retrieveSensorsData(sensorDict);
if( sensorDict.sensor1.on ) {
  console.log('It is the evening');
}
if( sensorDict.sensor2.val > 30 ) {
  console.log('It is hot today');
}
```

The above code is equivalent to the following:

```js
const gHA = global.get('homeassistant');
const ha = new HA(gHA);

if( ha.entity('input_boolean.evening').isOn() ) {
  console.log('It is the evening');
}
if( ha.entity('sensor.outdoor_temperature').asNumber() > 30 ) {
  console.log('It is hot today');
}
```
